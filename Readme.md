# What is miPereZ?

miPreZ is a minimal HTML slides framework to make slides easy to edit inline and online.

## How to use?

Just copy the HTML code of this presentation and edit away.

The simplicity of it allows me to just git clone the repo directly into my server and then just edit away.

## Are there any Themes?

Right now there are thre themes __light__ (default), __dark__ and __grad__. Just change the class in the body tag.

## Can I write Slide notes?

Yes, just use the class notes in a span at the bottom of the slide. 

The notes class isn't rendered, except in print if you set the handout class in body tag
