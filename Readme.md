# What is miPereZ?

miPreZ is a minimal HTML slides framework to make slides easy to edit inline and online.

## How to use?

Just copy the HTML code of this presentation and edit away.

The simplicity of it allows me to just git clone the repo directly into my server and then just edit away.

## Are there any Themes?

Right now there are two themes __dark__ and __light__. Just change the class in the body tag.
